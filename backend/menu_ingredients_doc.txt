1. Menu.belongsToMany(Ingredient, { through: MenuIngredient, foreignKey: 'menu_id' });
Menu.belongsToMany(Ingredient, ... ): This is defining a many-to-many relationship between 
the Menu model and the Ingredient model. It indicates that a Menu can have many Ingredients, 
and an Ingredient can belong to many Menus.

{ through: MenuIngredient, ... }: This specifies that the relationship is mediated through 
the MenuIngredient model (the join table). This join table will store the associations 
between Menus and Ingredients.

foreignKey: 'menu_id': This sets the foreign key in the MenuIngredient table that references 
the primary key of the Menu model. In other words, the menu_id column in the MenuIngredient 
table will hold the IDs of Menus.



2. Ingredient.belongsToMany(Menu, { through: MenuIngredient, foreignKey: 'ingredient_id' });
Ingredient.belongsToMany(Menu, ... ): This is defining the other side of the many-to-many 
relationship. It indicates that an Ingredient can belong to many Menus, and a Menu can 
have many Ingredients.

{ through: MenuIngredient, ... }: Again, this specifies that the relationship is mediated 
through the MenuIngredient model (the join table).

foreignKey: 'ingredient_id': This sets the foreign key in the MenuIngredient table that 
references the primary key of the Ingredient model. In other words, the ingredient_id 
column in the MenuIngredient table will hold the IDs of Ingredients.



Summary
These lines are setting up a many-to-many relationship between the Menu and Ingredient 
models using the MenuIngredient join table. This allows for each menu to have multiple 
ingredients and each ingredient to be part of multiple menus, with the relationship 
details (like quantity) stored in the MenuIngredient table.

In essence, they enable the creation of associations between Menu and Ingredient through 
the MenuIngredient table, using the menu_id and ingredient_id foreign keys to keep track 
of these associations.
